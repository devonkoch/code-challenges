## React

### The Challenge: 

Here is a very basic react app. It lists some items. You can click to select, and there is a filter you can change. 

Go ahead an get it running locally, then read on.

You must update the app to:
- [ ] Fetch options for the filter (keys of response from `http://www.kiddom.co/content/types.json`)
- [ ] Fetch items remotely from `http://www.kiddom.co/content.json?source=${key_from_filter}`

Please make sure you discuss your current level of familiarity with React with your interviewer before starting. If you say you're an expert, we'll expect you to be Googling different things than if you say you've only ever used Angular / Ember.
